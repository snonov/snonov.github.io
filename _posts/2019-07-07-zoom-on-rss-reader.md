Draft page, aim is to enrich in time this reflexion about rss reader to use.     

My usage of rss-reader is to practise some tech watch on how things are going. I was used to do it with Google Reader (that dropped the service), then Old Reader (victim of its sucess, new politic didn't feet my need) and now InoReader but its new politics limit (in free offering) number of feeds.     

So in reflexion to try a new one (or submit a non free offer ... depending).     


## My criteria

Can sum up to accessible, developer oriented, no need to estheticism but practical (I still find that cli is efficient)

A minimum :    
* Free offer cover my needs (number of feeds, search in feeds (including past))    
* Provides an API    
* Access through mobil device and laptop    

A plus :   
* eventually larger that just RSS (twitter, ...)    
* service through statistics, rules, tracker    

## some Readers

* NetVibes : [https://www.netvibes.com/en](https://www.netvibes.com/en)      
* OMEA : [https://www.jetbrains.com/omea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/omea/) to study but larger that RSS Reader, match developper oriented    
* FeedReader : [http://feedreader.com/](http://feedreader.com/)     
* HootSuite : [https://hootsuite.com/plans/free](https://hootsuite.com/plans/free)    
* NewsBlur : [https://newsblur.com/](https://newsblur.com/) nice but limit up to 64 feeds    

## After just a reader ... watch tool

Some watch tools (that include reader to do so) dedicated to journalism and data watch :
